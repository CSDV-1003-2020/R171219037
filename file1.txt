About Version Control System
version control system records the changes made to file or multiple files over time, so that they can 
be recalled later on.

TYPES
1. LOCAL VCS
To copy files in another directory, and keep the patch sets (differenes between files) in a disk, so 
that files can be re-created when required.

2. CENTRALIZED VCS
A single server contains all the versioned files, so that multiple users can access and collaboration 
can take place. the problem is that if the server goes down, then no one will be able to access any
file.

3. DISTRIBUTED VCS
Users have access to the complete history of files, including all commits, as they can simply mirror the repository. since there can be several remote repositories of the same file, various people can contribute on the same project in their own way.

ABOUT GIT
Git is very different from other version control systems. 
it takes a picture of how the project looks like, whenever we commit, and creates a reference to that snapshot, instead of storing the changes made to files.

THE THREE STATES
1. WORKING DIRECTORY: it is where new files are checked out. we can modify files here.
2. STAGING AREA: once we add files in git, they go to the staging area and are known as staged files.
3. REPOSITORY: once files have been committed, they reach the local repository.

TRACKED FILES: that git knows about
UNTRACKED FILES: any file that has not been staged or committed, that git does not know about. 
when you clone a repo, all files will be tracked and modified. however, when you start working on them, they will be identified as modified, staged etc.

COMMANDS:
1. IDENTITY: configure yourself once you install git
[git config --global user.name "Tanishka Vaswani"]
[git config --global user.email "tanishkavaswani1@gmail.com"]

2. to check all your settings
[git config --list]

3. to view all your settings and where they are coming from
[git config --list --show-origin]

4. to get help 
 [git help -a]

5. obtaining git repository
there are two ways of doing it
[git init]
through this, a git repository will be created.

cloning a git repository
git clone: to get a copy of the existing git repository.
[git clone <url> ]
through this command, a new directory will be created, pull down all the data,including the latest version of working copy. you can give a name of your choice to the directory

6. GIT STATUS
[git status] is a command which tells determines that which file is in which state. 
it tells you about your current working branch

[git status -s] is a command to view status in short and concise manner.

7. GIT ADD
a new file is tracked through [git add]. it is a multipurpose command, as it is used to track files, stage files and mark merge-conflicts as resolved.

IMP: Git stages a file exactly as it is when git add command is run.if you modify a file after your run git add, you have to run git add again to stage the latest version of the file.

8. IGNORING FILES
[create a file through vi .gitignore
name the files that you wish to ignore]

this helps us to create a set of files that we do not want git to add or even show as untracked.
do git diff also.

9. GIT DIFF
[git diff] is a command that can show exact lines added and removed for the files that are not staged
[git diff --staged] displays the changes for staged files
git diff --staged = git diff --cached

10. GIT COMMIT
[git commit -m "message"] is how you commit. 
every time you commit, you record a snapshot of your project
it displays your branch, SHA1, how many files were changed, statistics on lines added and removed.
[git commit -a -m "message"] is how you commit without adding.

11. REMOVING FILES
[git rm --cached filename] is how you remove a file from staging area,but it remains in working area.
[git rm filename.txt] is how you remove file that you have not modified
[git rm -f filename] is how you remove modified files.

12. GIT LOG
[git log] tells you about the commit history
[git log --stat] gives abbreviated stats for each commit
[git log --graph] gives you an ASCII graph showing your graph and merge history
--pretty changes the log output to formats other than the default
--oneline will print the commit history in a single line

13. UNDOING
to undo commit [git commit --amend]
to undo staging [git reset HEAD filename]
to undo modification [git checkout -- filename]

14. REMOTE
